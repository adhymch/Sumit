# Sumit
Java based application to measure the level of understandability of a software design

According to the research conducted by Mohd Nazir and Raees A. Khan (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212017312004057) in determine a metric for understandabilty, and how vital understanbility is. Understandability is one of key factor of software evolution in reuse or maintenance. So the goal of this application is to measure the level of understandability during design phase in a software life cycle. So that the developer can be aware of its maintainability in the early phase.

Sumit also will shows the value of cohesion, coupling, and inheritance metric of a design to determine its understandability. Therefore in terms of future works Sumit need to be study for some practical issue within industry and need to develop some features to be a reliable tool for developer
